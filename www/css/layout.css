STICKER - A valid, easy to use CSS sticky footer by Ryan Fait

This is the basic CSS you need along with the one extra empty
div and the wrapper required to achieve the effect. I suggest
that you leave the * { margin: 0; } code in while testing and
building your site because margins do have a tendency to mess
things up a bit. Have fun!

.footer, .push {
    height: 12pt;  /*.push must be the same height as .footer */
